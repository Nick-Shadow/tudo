# Tudo: todo list app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, not ready for any sort of alpha yet.

## Getting Started

First, install depenencies and then start the dev server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. This is the web facing landing page

You will find a web gui for the app itself on [http://localhost:3000/myapp](http://localhost:3000/myapp), this is designed for an individual user facing experiance.

<!-- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages. -->
